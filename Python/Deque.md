# Deque

Part of collections (`collections.deque`)

Cannot access middle in O(1) because it's a doubly linked list. Wanted if want to make it faster to pop and append.

There's pop and append, as well as popleft and appendleft. It does what it states.

Has insert, remove, count like normal. Has index as well, but index(ele, beg, end).
